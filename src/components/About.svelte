  <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 
    <br> 
    I am an ex-mathematics teacher looking to get into the tech industry. I completed the Northcoders full-stack coding bootcamp in October 2022 and now I am looking for roles as a full-stack engineer, a front-end dev or a back-end engineer. </p>
    <p>I'm a strong proponent of lifetime learning and I've found that coding has really inspired me - there's always more to learn! I'm looking to work in an organisation that shares this value and supports its staff to continuously develop and improve their practice.</p>
    <p>I'm currently based in Huddersfield but I am looking to relocate to just about anywhere! (Sorry Huddersfield!)</p>
